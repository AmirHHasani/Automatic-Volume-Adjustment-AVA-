# Automatic-Volume-Adjustment(AVA)
We designed this in an effort to lower the volume of a car's audio system automatically when passengers want to talk to each other without the need to change the volume of the audio system manually.

We decided to post this project in both our github pages so don't be surprised if you found 2 of this repository.
