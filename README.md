# Automatic-Volume-Adjustment(AVA)
We designed this in an effort to lower the volume of a car's audio system automatically when passengers want to talk to each other without the need to change the volume of the audio system manually

The first for loop serves as a delay function. It was put there because several other ready made functions that create delay, faced a problem and couldn't run properly. Hopefully we can develope this code further in the future.

You have to note that this version of the project is sensetive to all sounds. The second version of this project which uses silero vad and is only sensetive to human voice will be completed soon.

We decided to post this project in both our github pages so don't be surprised if you found 2 of this repository.
